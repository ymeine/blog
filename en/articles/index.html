I didn't note it down, but I would say roughly 6-7 years, around that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've been doing software development for 16 years now, including 5 years at school and therefore 11 years as a professional developer. And during that whole time I constantly watched the state of the art, I learned, experimented, tested things, created, reinvented the wheel many times, tested and switched technologies, and so on and so forth.\\r\\n\\r\\n{/* excerpt-end */}\\r\\n\\r\\nI actually have tens of current projects, and had a bunch more by the past. Some I kind of dropped, some that stayed and evolved purely on my mind, some I coded partially, and often rewrote from scratch 2 or 3 times. It's actually hard to both develop projects and keep up with the technologies when having very little spare time. Plus, I may talk about how I used to work in a future blog post, but I was never doing things by the book... It was probably good for learning how to get crafty, but not so much for projects maintenance and durability: I could never enjoy the full potential of existing tools.\\r\\n\\r\\n### The reasons\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first reason why I'm creating a blog: I now have more free time — actually I'm full time on my projects. So to me an additional blog project is ok to fit in. I'll probably dedicate an article to listing all the projects I work on or have on my roadmap, plus those I worked on by the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second reason is that, despite all those years I spent practicing **SO MUCH**, I could not really achieve anything I consider ready for sharing with the world: libraries, applications, tools. I actually have very high quality expectations regarding what I create — maybe too high sometimes, that's something I'm still working on. Also, as I said above, spare time was short, technologies evolve fast, and I had to make a choice: favor learning or achievement. I chose the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, what I can start sharing from now on is *knowledge, experience*. It's just a matter of writing nice articles, which takes time, but has much less constraints than sharing code, programs or else.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother reason, summarized by the quote I saw on [that blog](https://www.internalpointers.com/):\\r\\n\\r\\n> I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I write and I understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really like that quote since I always understood much more when writing documentation or explaining things to people, and sharing content in a blog is similar, just a bit more fun.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Separator />\\r\\n\\r\\n## What you will find in here\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, as you could guess: topics related to software development. But which ones in particular? That's the thing: I don't set myself any limit. I want this blog to be generalist, but still dive deep in details when I want.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven my experience, expect more content regarding web development in every sense, and maybe more on the side of frontend. But I'll also share about systems development, automation, methodology/organization, maybe hardware, and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will also add some topics related to my other passion: music making.\\r\\n<Icon icon={musicIcon} height='1.5em' style={{verticalAlign: 'bottom'}} /> Stay tuned <Icon icon={musicIcon} height='1.5em' style={{verticalAlign: 'bottom'}} />\\r\\n\\r\\n<Separator />\\r\\n\\r\\n## How I started creating this blog\\r\\n\\r\\n### The requirements\\r\\n\\r\\nA blog has specific requirements, and I identify these ones as the top priorities:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **be performant**: it's mostly pure reading material, people won't forgive a slow load or a laggy scroll, both on desktop or mobile\\r\\n- **be SEO/metadata friendly**: what would be the purpose if people can't find or share the blog properly?\\r\\n- **be appealing**: I need to make sure that a user wants to stay, and for that I need full control over the design and features of my blog\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I have my own requirements as well, and that is:\\r\\n\\r\\n- use DX-friendly technologies, matching my skills and my desire of control\\r\\n- have a purely static website (I'll explain that below)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Picking the right tool\\r\\n\\r\\nFor performance and SEO/metadata, which are topics I'm not 100% comfortable with, I first thought about using a CMS, [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) being at the top of the list. But that wouldn't have matched the \\\&quot;DX-friendly\\\&quot; and \\\&quot;purely static website\\\&quot; requirements. WordPress is [PHP](https://www.php.net/) based, requires a full backend stack, and allows UI control mostly through customization, not from the ground up (AFAIK).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I really feel comfortable with is creating content using frameworks or libraries that I usually use for applications development, but which are fully capable or making websites. So in that field of modern tools, things like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) or [Astro](https://astro.build/) came out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTools in the category of Hugo or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) use specific or marginal templating languages and conventions, which means that if I ever wanna change the tool, I will have to rewrite much more code compared to if I pick one of the options I present next.\\r\\n\\r\\nGatsby and Astro on the other hand belong to another category: they mix static site generation features with famous components libraries like [React](https://react.dev/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/), which were initially used more for full client-side SPA development. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is another option, but when I picked my choice I think it was still not ready for static site export in version 13.\\r\\n\\r\\nGatsby didn't feel so appealing regarding DX. It is also locking to React. Don't get me wrong, I love React — for the good and the bad — but when I saw that Astro looked dead simple, progressive and could support most of the modern component libraries — including React, Preact, Svelte, Solid, Vue, Qwik — I didn't hesitate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least at first.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll share more details about the process, the technical aspects, the pros and cons of Astro and the researches I made to see if other tools would fill its gaps. But that will be for a future blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What do I mean by \\\&quot;purely static website\\\&quot;?\\r\\n\\r\\nAll websites and web-based applications can potentially work without a backend. In that case, the server only hosts and serves what we refer to as \\\&quot;static files\\\&quot;, without interpreting them. The whole execution process happens exclusively on the client side. Such files are HTML, CSS or JavaScript, as well as potentially other assets like images.\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting rid of a \\\&quot;dynamic\\\&quot; backend has a big advantage: it opens the door to more hosting solutions, which are usually free. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is hosting that blog right now, is a perfect choice since I already use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to handle my projects. And I even went onboard with their comments system [Giscus](https://giscus.app/). It's all consistent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever here I implicitly added another meaning to the denomination \\\&quot;purely static website\\\&quot;: I needed a tool that can render the whole — or most of the — website content at **build** time, instead of having an almost empty, single HTML page which would be filled by JavaScript on the client side. With that, we tick two important requirements:\\r\\n\\r\\n- SEO/metadata: since the content is directly on the server\\r\\n- performance: since the browser will quickly paint what it receives, before executing any JavaScript code\\r\\n\\r\\nGo ahead, check the [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) report on that page or try sharing the article on social networks...\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\nand don't hesitate to report bugs on [the repo](https://github.com/ymeine/blog/issues) btw 😄.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Separator />\\r\\n\\r\\n## What's next?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I said earlier, I'll share more details about the blog creation process in a future post. It's already listed in the [roadmap](/roadmap).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy not now? One could argue this is completely in sync with this article's topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nI choose not now because I have set myself another very important requirement: keep articles concise. People nowadays don't have time to read, not everything, not with a list of videos to watch as well, with series to follow, video games to complete, social life to fulfill. Myself included.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the frequency of posting, I was thinking at least one article a month. I failed for the first month: it was an exceptionally very busy one, and I also needed to fine tune MANY things for this blog. But I'm confident for the next ones...\\r\\n\\r\\n... unless I decide to enjoy summer a bit harder 🌞😎🍸\\r\\n\&quot;],\&quot;collection\&quot;:[0,\&quot;articles\&quot;],\&quot;data\&quot;:[0,{\&quot;title\&quot;:[0,\&quot;Building a blog: why, what and a glimpse of how\&quot;],\&quot;description\&quot;:[0,\&quot;I explain why I am doing this blog, what can be expected from it, and how I achieved it.\&quot;],\&quot;pubDate\&quot;:[3,\&quot;2023-07-11T17:32:10.000Z\&quot;],\&quot;tags\&quot;:[1,\&quot;[[0,\\\&quot;blog\\\&quot;],[0,\\\&quot;personal-experience\\\&quot;]]\&quot;],\&quot;readingTime\&quot;:[0,\&quot;6m\&quot;],\&quot;updatedDate\&quot;:[3,\&quot;2023-07-11T17:32:10.000Z\&quot;]}],\&quot;render\&quot;:[0,null]}],\&quot;readingTime\&quot;:[0,\&quot;6m\&quot;],\&quot;href\&quot;:[0,\&quot;/blog/en/articles/001-building-a-blog-why-what-and-a-glimpse-of-how/\&quot;]}]]&quot;]}" ssr="" client="load" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;ArticlesList&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:true}" await-children=""><ul class="_list_1v32y_12"><li class="_article_1v32y_23"><a class="_title_1v32y_39" href="/blog/en/articles/001-building-a-blog-why-what-and-a-glimpse-of-how/">Building a blog: why, what and a glimpse of how</a><div class="_tags_1v32y_80"><div class="badge badge-info">blog</div><div class="badge badge-info">personal-experience</div></div><div class="_details_1v32y_29"><div class="_row_1v32y_1"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M20 11H4V8h16m0 7h-7v-2h7m0 6h-7v-2h7m-9 2H4v-6h7m9.33-8.33L18.67 3L17 4.67L15.33 3l-1.66 1.67L12 3l-1.67 1.67L8.67 3L7 4.67L5.33 3L3.67 4.67L2 3v16a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h16a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V3l-1.67 1.67Z"></path></svg>Published:<time>July 11, 2023</time></div><div class="_readingTime_1v32y_105"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" role="img" width="1rem" height="1rem" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M12 2A10 10 0 0 0 2 12a10 10 0 0 0 10 10a10 10 0 0 0 10-10A10 10 0 0 0 12 2m4.2 14.2L11 13V7h1.5v5.2l4.5 2.7l-.8 1.3Z"></path></svg> 6m reading time</div><div class="_draft_1v32y_53"></div><div class="_spacer_1v32y_8"></div><div class="_comments_1v32y_45"><div class="_statsLoader_1v32y_98"><div class="loading loading-spinner loading-md"></div><div>Loading comments</div></div></div></div></li></ul></astro-island>
